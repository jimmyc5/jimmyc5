- 👋 Hi, I’m @jimmyc5 ! I'm a student at UVA and the current president of Student Game Developers at UVA.
- 👀 I’m interested in both game development and web development.
- 🌱 I currently use and am always learning tools in both web and game dev. I've made it a habit to practice Unity, React, and Angular as much as I can.
- 📫 You can reach me at jjc9bb@virginia.edu
- 🎮 If you'd like to see some game projects Ive worked on, I have an itch.io page where you can play them: https://jimmyc5.itch.io/
- 💻 (some of them will have the code on GitHub below. You can also find some of my Web Development projects below.)
