- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jimmyc5 ! I'm a student at UVA and the current president of Student Game Developers at UVA.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in both game development and web development.
- ðŸŒ± I currently use and am always learning tools in both web and game dev. I've made it a habit to practice Unity, React, and Angular as much as I can.
- ðŸŽ® If you'd like to see some game projects I've worked on, I have an itch.io page where you can play them: https://jimmyc5.itch.io/
- ðŸ’» On this GitHub, you'll find the code for some of those games, as well as some of my Web Development projects.
- ðŸ“« If you'd like to reach me, I can be found at jjc9bb@virginia.edu .
